# Wireframes / storyboards
> Based on the sketches I developed last week and the feedback received from my classmates during our Wednesday class session, I have enhanced the story with new elements. The narrative now concludes with a bold, compelling ending and a clear action plan. You can view this updated version at the following Shorthand link: https://preview.shorthand.com/BkR9PVc1BExR65OX

# User research 

## Target audience
My approach focuses on university students aged 25-30 with an interest in gaming, covering all genders. The intent is to connect with those who see gaming as more than just a hobby, resonating with both the competitive and cognitive facets of gaming culture.

## Interview script
I prepared, the following set of questions:
1- What stood out to you after reading the entire story? Were there any specific emotions that were sparked as you progressed through it?
2- How effectively does the story link the narrative of chess with its popularity, technological advancements, benefits, and the overall flow? Did it convey the message clearly and keep you engaged throughout?
3- Were there any data visualizations or infographics that caught your attention? Do you have any suggestions for improvement?
4- As a member of the target audience—a young student with multiple hobbies who enjoys playing games—do you feel empowered or inspired to start playing chess?


## Interview findings

| Student | Question #1 Highlights and Emotional Responses | Question #2 Story's Connection and Clarity | Questions #3 Visuals and Suggestions | Question #4 Motivation to Play Chess |
|---------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| 1       | What stood out to me - Interest in chess has increased over the recent years and people now more than ever are getting more experience. I think the only emotion that I processed was concern that the AI bots are at a much higher level than people are. That makes sense, but I have never seen the data behind it.  | I think the story did a good job overall. It was easy to follow along. I think you hit many main points that I was interested in learning about. I am unsure if there is any data for the benefits, but I would like to see that.  | I like the child prodigy visualization. The one suggestion I have for that graphic is to maybe add color to the count of age so that it is a little more differentiable. I think one color there made it a little harder to interpret. I liked the ability to filter in the yearly growth and robot graphics. | I have tried to start playing chess, but I am so horrible at it. If there is any way for you to include ways to get started like videos explaining the game better, I think that would be the most helpful!  |
| 2       | Surprised by younger kids' success in chess, neat and clear visuals. | Clear uptick in chess playing, interested in benefits data. | Suggests line chart for time-series, bubble chart clarity. | Liked call to action, motivated to play. |
| 3       | AI advancements, ELO differences, and chess benefits stood out. | Sees connection, suggests more precise storytelling. | Yearly growth graph interest, wants more engaging visuals. | Inspired to learn chess, hopes to compete. |
