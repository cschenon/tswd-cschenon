# Wireframes / storyboards
> Based on the sketches I developed last week and the feedback received from my classmates during our Wednesday class session, I have enhanced the story with new elements. The narrative now concludes with a bold, compelling ending and a clear action plan. You can view this updated version at the following [Shorthand link](https://preview.shorthand.com/BkR9PVc1BExR65OX).

# User research 

## Target audience
My approach focuses on university students aged 25-30 with an interest in gaming, covering all genders. The intent is to connect with those who see gaming as more than just a hobby, resonating with both the competitive and cognitive facets of gaming culture.

## Interview script
I prepared, the following set of questions:

Question #1 - What stood out to you after reading the entire story? Were there any specific emotions that were sparked as you progressed through it?

Question #2 - How effectively does the story link the narrative of chess with its popularity, technological advancements, benefits, and the overall flow? Did it convey the message clearly and keep you engaged throughout?

Question #3 - Were there any data visualizations or infographics that caught your attention? Do you have any suggestions for improvement?

Question #4 - As a member of the target audience—a young student with multiple hobbies who enjoys playing games—do you feel empowered or inspired to start playing chess?

## Interview findings

| Student | Question #1 Highlights and Emotional Responses | Question #2 Story's Connection and Clarity | Questions #3 Visuals and Suggestions | Question #4 Motivation to Play Chess |
|---------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| 1       | What stood out to me - Interest in chess has increased over the recent years and people now more than ever are getting more experience. I think the only emotion that I processed was concern that the AI bots are at a much higher level than people are. That makes sense, but I have never seen the data behind it.  | I think the story did a good job overall. It was easy to follow along. I think you hit many main points that I was interested in learning about. I am unsure if there is any data for the benefits, but I would like to see that.  | I like the child prodigy visualization. The one suggestion I have for that graphic is to maybe add color to the count of age so that it is a little more differentiable. I think one color there made it a little harder to interpret. I liked the ability to filter in the yearly growth and robot graphics. | I have tried to start playing chess, but I am so horrible at it. If there is any way for you to include ways to get started like videos explaining the game better, I think that would be the most helpful!  |
| 2       | I liked the graphs and pictures. It was very neat and clear. The insights around younger kids being more successful now in chess was surprising and interesting at the same time. I liked the whole flow of the story as well, it had a nice narrative and structure. | It did clearly convey that there is an uptick in people playing chess and younger kids being more successful. I also liked the benefits of chess listed in the end. However, I would like to see what the data look like for people who play chess vs those who don't, especially with respect to the benefits. | I would make the first bar chart as a line chart because it is a time-series metric - line charts show that continuous nature. The bubble chart was very interesting but not easy to read. It took me some time to get to the key insight. | Yes, I really liked the ending and the clear call to action. I did end up clicking the link and playing a game. |
| 3       | Things that stood out to me were the advancements of AI systems in the game of chess. No wonder they are taking over humans in different walks of life. There is a significant difference between the ELO peaks. Also, the several benefits this game provides.   | I do see a connection in your storyline, the evolution of chess over time. I would have loved a few more components in your story which could have conveyed the message more precisely. | The yearly growth graph of number of chess grandmasters. I want to know why there was a peak during the years 2006-2010. You can add that to your story. Also, I think the visuals can be made more engaging. Expand your graphs, highlighting text might help. | I always wanted to play chess. Going through your story inspires me to learn it even more. Maybe I will beat you in a few months. |


# Identified changes for Part III
To update and improve my storytelling assignment, I plan to:

- Implement color differentiation in the Child Prodigy visualization to clarify age ranges.
  
- Enhance the conclusion with resources and tips for beginners to learn chess.
  
- Convert the initial bar chart into a line chart to better represent the time-series data and illustrate trends more clearly.
  
- Simplify the bubble chart to make it easier to extract key insights.
  
- Add my chess.com username at the end of the assignment to invite interactions and further discussions.
