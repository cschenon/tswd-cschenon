# Outline
- **Introduction: The Evolution of Chess as a Competitive Sport**  
  Just like any other sport, Chess is continuously evolving. Similar to how records in the 100-meter dash are broken almost every Olympics, chess experiences its own form of progress with ELO rankings reaching new heights over time.

- **Increasing Popularity**  
  Chess is also becoming increasingly popular, as evidenced by the following trends.

- **The Impact of Technology on Chess**  
  Technology has significantly altered the landscape of chess. AI has achieved levels of play that are extremely challenging for humans to match, as illustrated in the following ELO comparison.

- **The Rise of Young Prodigies**  
  With easier access to technology, the game is not just changing; it's also facilitating the emergence of new, young prodigies.

- **Conclusion: Embracing Technology**  
  It's enlightening to observe how new generations are leveraging technology to enhance their gameplay. Instead of viewing technology as a foe, embracing it as a tool can elevate your game to new heights.

# The data
I've been exploring sources for obtaining data and have come across some datasets on the Kaggle page, as shown here:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryaman1a/top-chess-players-in-the-world
https://www.kaggle.com/code/arindambaruah/who-is-dominating-women-s-chess/input
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishabh6377/worlds-chess-grandmasters-data

I plan to upload the data into Tableau to experiment with it and determine the best visualization options for the story I intend to tell. I will include the source of my information below each graph. Additionally, I've found some copyright-free images on Pexels that could enhance my storytelling, such as the following image:

I plan to incorporate these types of images to enrich the narrative.

# Method and medium
I plan to use Tableau and ArcGIS Story Maps to tell my story. Although I still need to research how to use these tools effectively, I am confident that I will be able to create compelling storytelling and make a significant impact on my audience.
