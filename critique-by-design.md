# Critique by Design with Tableau (MakeoverMonday)

**Step one: choose a data visualization from MakeoverMonday**
I selected the "Global Electric Vehicle Market Share" visualization from the https://makeovermonday.co.uk/ website, created by Counterpoint Research on February 13, 2023. I chose this because the electric vehicle (EV) market is garnering public interest due to its environmental impact and the disruptive innovations it brings. Additionally, upon viewing the graph, I immediately saw how it could be improved. I struggled to understand it at first glance, something that could have been mitigated with a better design.

**Step two: critique the data visualization**
This is the graph:

**Step three: sketch out a solution**


**Step four: Test the solution**


**Step five: Build your solution**
