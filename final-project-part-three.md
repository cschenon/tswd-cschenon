# The final data story
[Link to my final data story on Shorthand](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/renaissance-of-chess/index.html)

However, after publishing it for an hour already, I noticed that the Tableau graphs are not rendering, so I will also share the preview link here: [https://preview.shorthand.com/BkR9PVc1BExR65OX](https://preview.shorthand.com/BkR9PVc1BExR65OX)

The story is about: The Renaissance of Chess in the Digital Age
In 2020, chess experienced a resurgence in popularity due to the COVID-19 lockdowns and the release of 'The Queen's Gambit' on Netflix. This renewed interest led people to online platforms and YouTube channels like GothamChess for learning and entertainment. Despite the challenge of becoming a Grandmaster, requiring an ELO of 2,500, the number of Grandmasters has increased, showcasing the game's growing appeal.
Technological advancements have also transformed chess, with AI systems now outperforming humans in ELO scores. This evolution has made chess more accessible, particularly for young prodigies who, thanks to resources like Stockfish, are reaching Grandmaster status at unprecedented rates.
Chess offers numerous benefits, from enhancing memory and creativity to improving emotional intelligence and cognitive health. I show through my story, how you are just a click away from start playing this awesome game.

# Changes made since Part II
After interviewing three students and showing them part 2 of my assignment, I made several changes to my work:

I implemented color differentiation in the 'Grandmaster Milestones: The Ages Chess Prodigies Claimed the Title' graph to clarify age ranges. Previously, it was all colored in blue; after receiving feedback, I changed the size of the circles and created a green gradient to highlight younger players.

I refined my conclusion by incorporating resources that guide my audience on how to start playing chess online. This includes a link to chess.com and two instructional YouTube videos for beginners on playing with both the white and black pieces. This method seamlessly ties the ending to the beginning of my narrative, where I initially mentioned the YouTuber GothamChess. To come full circle, I conclude by showcasing two of his tutorials, providing a practical step for learning the game.

To enhance engagement with the narrative, I shared my personal journey, illustrating the potential for progress in chess over time. To establish credibility, I included my personal statistics from chess.com, along with a photo of myself participating in a tournament.

I also made significant changes concerning copyright; I ended up removing some pictures due to the lack of information about their copyright conditions. I preferred to delete them rather than face potential issues. Additionally, I included new copyright-free images to enhance my narrative.

## The audience
After completing my interviews, I realized that all my interviewees were interested in playing chess online after learning about the ongoing trends. This confirmed that my target audience was well-defined: young students in their 20s and 30s, as well as individuals likely to have games already installed on their phones. That's why I incorporated the chess.com link at the end of the presentation as my call to action.

# Final thoughts
I truly enjoyed sharing my story through this assignment, having started playing chess in 2020. It allowed me to share not only the dynamics of the game but also part of the ecosystem, including chess engines, players, YouTube influencers, and openings. This was an opportunity to share a bit of the new knowledge I've obtained. I've also experienced significant cognitive improvements by playing the game; chess has enhanced my creativity by constantly challenging me to think of new strategies against my opponent.
Additionally, as a player, the need to perform calculations has sharpened my mental math skills. Preparing for my master's degree at CMU, I had to take the GRE, and I believe chess helped me perform mental calculations with ease.

The course also provided new perspectives on data presentation. I particularly enjoyed creating the 'Grandmaster Milestones: The Ages Chess Prodigies Claimed the Title' graph. It was challenging to visualize at first, but I'm proud of how I presented various variables simultaneously: the year the title was obtained and the player's age, in a way that's impactful for viewers.

Before this course, I hadn't placed much importance on a graph's title or the story it tells. I now realize the value of this aspect and believe I've gained new knowledge in this area.
